        <h1>PROJECT IDEAS</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This is your first time come to Vietnam? Google Maps just only shows you some popular place such as famous church, museum, or famous shopping mall which are well known, these suggestions are quite boring because it completely does not describe life in the local area, the nooks and crannies where these local people often gather, where cultural dishes that famous landmarks may not be able to bring you - a tourist.</p>
        <br>
        <p>JustGo will be the perfect web app which will go with you everywhere, anytime you need. JustGo will give suggestions about places to eat, to visit, places that are said to be secretly containing the "soul" of that locality. All are recommended by reviews of locals and other travelers including prices, the service, the weather, ATM, medical store, hospital, public toilets, etc. Because of the flexibility, enhancing the user experience, the quintessential things may not be discovered and felt, but thanks to the reviews, tourists can also enjoy the beauty and taste of this place. In a way indigenous people enjoy it, this sense of familiarity has made JustGo stand out among other mapping applications. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Language is also one of the obstacles for tourists, but don't worry JustGo has provided Image Recognition feature, just take a photo of the place or food ... all information will be provided fully. (price, service, food, ...). Besides, visitors can also learn more about the history, the process of forming a place to visit, or derive from the dishes without having to have a tour guide, JustGo will provide the history of they also add to the deepening tourist experience.</p>

        <br>
        <p>When traveling, what I have always wondered about is which place is fun, what is interesting, what restaurant is good, what is the price, what is the service? This is what motivates me to come up with the idea of creating JustGo. Vietnam's tourism industry is one of the potential industries that will bring a lot of profits to the country. Vietnam National Administration of Tourism reported that 2019 is a breakthrough in the tourism industry, Vietnam increasingly affirms itself with friends around the world through positive numbers like in 2019, Vietnam has welcomed 18 million foreign tourists which is the highest number recorded to date. Domestically, the number of tourists reaches 85 million from provinces. The tourism industry alone contributed 9.2% of the GDP growth when the revenue reached $ 32.6 billion. Although the growth is very positive, the tourism industry in Vietnam still has a number of hurdles, JustGo wants to connect tourists with local businesses, giving the most affordable suggestions match with personal preferences as well as implement a win-win model when both visitors and businesses benefit from connecting with each other which creates value for JustGo's platform.</p>
