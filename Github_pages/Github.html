    <h1>Overview of Github and Git</h1>      
    <p>Before getting to know Git, let’s have a quick understanding about Source Control. 
        Source control is a source code management system that supports multiple people working on a project and managing changes (Amazon, n.d). In it, people can freely write code in their own parts without worrying about conflict with code among group members. People can view an individual's code change or revert to an earlier version without worrying about losing code.
        </p>

    <div class="col-sm-5">
      <p>Git was created by Linus Torvald in 2005, it is a management tool for open source and commercial software development (HubSpot, 2020). Git is also known as a source control which allows developers to see all the timeline of changes, they can access the history of the project, support working in any time zone, and have no restrictions on communication. Many benefits for individuals, teams or businesses (GitHub, 2020).

        <p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service and has many additional features (Klint, 2012). Git is understood as a tool that provides commands for users to manipulate with GitHub, and GitHub provides an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use interface for beginners. 
      </p>
      <p>GitHub builds close cooperation in the development process, the work is organized into sections so that developers can figure out directions, set requirements, develop ideas and decentralize with their team members. With GitHub, the developer just needs to create another branch to update the code, commit changes and pull a request to discuss about the changes, and then merge pull requests to notify everyone of the changes.</p>

          <p>There are 6 steps in GitHub flow:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Create a branch</li>
              <li>Add commits</li>
              <li>Open a pull request</li>
              <li>Discuss and review code</li>
              <li>Merge</li>
              <li>Deploy</li>
