        <p>Here are the 3 feedback from my teammate, fortunately, because there is Sourabi Baskaran in my group who is a foreign student, so I received very honest feedback from her. Most people like my idea because it is one of those unreleased apps in Vietnam, and people find it handy to point out new things even native speakers have the location is also looking for. Linh also liked my idea when I had the comparison with JustGo and Google Maps which make my ideas more unique. Besides, thanks to Vu because he showed me the challenges in this project such as competitor problem and typically “Foody”. For food review apps, most users only know that restaurant through advertising and directly search it on the app, it minimizes the scope of finding many delicious restaurants in that area. These applications often work vigorously on social media to promote restaurants, but for tourists who do not know anything about Vietnam, a map application with recommendations about places to visit, where to eat and drink is much more convenient, so JustGo is confident to be the pioneer web app in concept. JustGo is a product for both Vietnamese visitors, foreign visitors, and even local people. However, for long-term businesses, not knowledgeable about technology, JustGo is ready to assist when they need help, besides JustGo will run the team to search and experience it by themselves. Sharing on the map, joining hands to "enrich" the map of Vietnam is one of the solutions for now.</p>
