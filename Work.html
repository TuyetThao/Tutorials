        <p>Masa (23 years old) is a Game Programmer in Tokyo - Japan</p>
        <br>
        <p>He is working at Bandai Namco Inc. which is one of the biggest game company in Japan</p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">At 10 a.m, when coming to his desk at the company, the first thing he does is checking email and internal company social network for updating today’s tasks. He always has a fast breakfast right on his desk because he does not want to waste his time. After finishing his breakfast, he spends all the morning coding his task. At 12 p.m, he often hangs out with his co-workers to have lunch in nearby restaurants or convenience stores and plays some games for entertainment. At 1 p.m, he keeps up with his code, he also has some meeting with his team if necessary. In the meeting, he will give some suggestions for the game operation, future plan as well as persuade all team members to accept his idea. After that, he will present this plan to game directors in another meeting. If his plan is confirmed, he will start to do it as the new tasks with his team. He often ends his work around 7 p.m to 8 p.m depend on his recent situation. With Masa, I think his most challenging work comes from coding, we can see that he needs too much concentration for this work and he must find something to relax after working with it. Coding is also his capture of work that shows the essence of the IT industry.</p>

        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Her work is analyzing data and reporting them, for example, when another project team from the company released a new engine or product, she will check and follow the data of these products during the week to make sure nothing unreasonable data appears. If she finds some issues with the data, she can also revise the matching algorithm. Until finding all the issues, and revising them, she needs to have a data report meeting with that project team. In the meeting, she needs to show her logical thinking, what she changed in the algorithm and why she changed it. Since the whole group agreed, they focus on the schedule to release the product. These works cycle just keep it like that every week. She continues with a new project after having a meeting with the CEO, she will receive the project progress as well as the action plans. Then she and her data team will analyze this project and separate it into small tasks. Finally, before going home, she checks messages of all teams, feedback from customers, and lists tomorrow’s tasks. Her job revolves around statistics, algorithm design, data problem solving, reporting results, and ensuring the product's data circuit works stably. With Kaya, a designing algorithm for the project is the most challenged work because she needs to imagine all the workflow of this project and go deep inside each feature. Working with data is her capture of work that shows the essence of the IT industry.</p>
