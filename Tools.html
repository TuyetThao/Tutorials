        <h2>The role of audit trail on the GitHub repository</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">When looking at the overall in the audit trail, most of my work focuses on the final week before the deadline. Due to most of that, I do not work with GitHub. Most of the time I wrote reports on my word files until 11/26/2020, I just started creating a new repository and pushed my first templates of the webpage on GitHub. However, on 6/12/2020, which was also the deadline for Group Participation, I had to create a new repository because I encountered a conflict between the old code and the code I just finished. A week later, I did not use GitHub at all because I had to research and write the report for assignment 2. Starting 14/12/2020 onwards, I used GitHub more to push my template as well as update the content for each webpage. With my audit trail, I found that it helps me to review all my work timeline, as well as know the work on each specific day that I did. In the future, when working in groups, I think the audit trail helps a lot in reflecting the performance of each team member and thereby managing the workflow of the team more easily. Thanks to an audit trail, we can make an assessment based on the performance of each person. I will definitely use it for assignment 3, to ensure fairness in teamwork and management of our workflow.</p>
