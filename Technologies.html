        <h1>IT TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
        <br>
        <p>There are 5 main technologies are used to build JustGo website:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Cloud computing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Cloud computing is a term for storing and accessing information technology data through the Internet, it stores all data from the server, cloud computing also helps us to access data remotely (Steve, 2018). In this project, AWS (Amazon Web Services) acts as a server to launch applications, managing code files for both the front-end and the back-end. AWS is the right low-cost base platform which provides full functions for a new project like JustGo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>AWS includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service offering. Providing organizations with tools like computing power, database storage, and content delivery services. Goverment agencies, education institutions, non-profits, and private organizations all use AWS. AWS is comprised of 24 product categories, each service will be structured in a different way based on their needs such as storage, networking & content delivery, compute, management tools, analysis, learning machine, security, AR, VR, etc. Over time, AWS has added services that help make it a highly available scalable low-cost infrastructure platform. AWS also has data centers placed around the world competing with Microsoft, Google, and IBM.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a beginner so the interface is very important to me as well. AWS has done that by giving users a friendly server interface, not only that it allows a large number of applications and services to be accessed at the same time and it can be said that AWS is one of the most powerful web hosting platforms. to the present time. It does not require too much test skills and experience to use. It is a server with unlimited capacity so I do not care about the amount of data entered from the customer or stakeholder. Finally, it must be said that the absolute trust in reliable, encryption and security of AWS is because Amazon is one of the leading technology companies in the world, reducing worries about being hacked or stolen.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After seeing through many different server platforms, I found that AWS has the most convenient tools, clearly arranged and easy to understand on the interface. Each function has its own manual page without having to search for usage from other sources. Not only that, I used to use WordPress before, but that site was unable to last long due to hacker issues. In 2018, up to 90% of WordPress websites were hacked, not only that, users' documents and data were often damaged or lost (Nick, 2019). I hope AWS will do its job better.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Cybersecurity and Privacy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The encryption algorithm is an encryption process that transforms information by mathematical methods to generate a string of cryptic characters for security purposes, all information is only authorized parties can access it and those who do not have authority. Access is not possible (proofpoint, nd). Choosing the encryption algorithm to secure customer information is what JustGo wants to ensure because JustGo wants to build a brand name that is reliable, user-friendly and extremely useful.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/tech1.PNG" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>Encryption does not prevent information from being stolen but the stolen information cannot be used or read, encryption brings more security for information especially in the 4.0 era like today. Just like when we use ATMs or make online payments, encryption is used to secure information from harm. There are 3 main components for storing encryption systems: data, encryption engine, and key management (Aislyn, 2015).</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/tech2.PNG" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>Symmetric and asymmetric are two types of ciphers that are widely used to decide which cryptography best conceals information, and which variables are used as the key to make the encrypted message unique (Margaret, 2020).</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The symmetric cipher is seen as secret key encryption and uses a single key. Symmetric-key algorithms are divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. There are a lot of algorithms that are used such as Twofish, IDEA Serpent, AES, RC4, TDES, etc (Zainul, 2018).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Asymmetric ciphers are seen as public-key encryption, use 2 different keys. One private key for keeping secrets and 1 public key.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The stronger development of information technology, the more emergence of cyberattacks. This information increasingly becomes "prey" for hackers because they can use it to sell to businesses or threaten, ... The encryption algorithm is more desirable with the functionality to prevent this problem. Currently, the encryption algorithm has many solutions to hinder the speed of attacks by providing fake data at each wrong password guess and reporting to the server about someone intentionally logged in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For me, security is always at the forefront when choosing an application, especially banking applications, stock apps, daily communication applications and applications with online payment capabilities. I had my information stolen once and it caused a lot of consequences for me and it took a lot of time to do the paperwork involved. So that is always been a lesson for me in choosing which apps to use.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the great assistants for JustGo, thanks to AI, we cannot come up with algorithms that help provide reasonable suggestions to personalize their trip through habits, preferences, and suggestions related to what customers are searching for. AI is used in 2 functions of JustGo: search engine and chatbot. AI is simply understood as a technology that mimics human abilities, it can learn, perceive and process natural language, it also has the ability to self-edit in the learning process to solve complex human problems (Robert & Wallace, nd). To be pacific, AI is defined as thinking humanly, thinking rationally, acting humanly, and acting rationally (Russell & Norvig, n.d).</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinking humanly: Thinking like humans is an unbelievable thing when it comes to machines. People have many different levels of emotions, different insides, and different thoughts. But for AI, thanks to the process of interacting and learning with humans, it gradually updates and offers solutions as well as analyzing human emotions, processing natural language systems in dialogue to build systematically build psychology and get human awareness.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Thinking rationally: Make judgments that are right, reasonable, and true to the moral standards of a person.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Acting humanly: Turing stated that acting humanly is the ability that AI can achieve the same performance as a human in handling all tasks.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Acting rationally: Acting to achieve your goals with the same beliefs as a person.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>AI brings a lot of positive impacts. AI applies a lot in everyday applications such as browser applications, youtube, Facebook, Instagram along restaurant search applications or e-commerce applications. An improvement in the virtual assistant is Siri which is adopted by Apple inc, it makes the phone more convenient to control the phone by voice, for example when I want to set the alarm at 7 am tomorrow, I do not need to wake up and walk over the desk to set up, I just say "Hey Siri, I want to set the alarm at 7 am tomorrow", Siri will manually manipulate that for me. AI has made it easier for people to filter the information they really need, significantly improving work efficiency when AI can learn and take on supposedly repetitive tasks, delivering happiness for humans and bring many economic benefits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a marketer, AI contributes a lot in reaching the right customers that the brand wants, increasing engagement, and saving marketing costs, making it easy to launch campaigns to promote products. bring high efficiency. In marketing, AI helps to make suggestions to bring customers to the brand, along with keywords, AI will understand customers' wishes. AI collects a large amount of data about their interests, information and habits. I can rely on the collected data to synthesize and come up with the most effective brand development ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Chatbots â€“ Natural Language</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Chatbots is a computer program that can interact with people and make a conversation with people which is defined as AI based computer program. A chatbot is also considered as a virtual assistant when it can process requests or answer human queries quickly (Snigdha, 2020). JustGo also needs chatbots as a companion to help us in customer service, provide solutions and answer customer questions immediately, I believe that chatbots will help us improve the amount of interaction and do not lost customers. Chatbots are based on analyzing the purpose and request of the user and extracting relevant feedback. Chatbots use 3 classification methods: pattern matching, understanding the natural language (NLU), and processing the natural language (NLP).</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/tech3.PNG" alt="">
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Pattern matching: The developer will prepare text circuits so that the Bot can respond appropriately to the customer and guide the customer. For example:</li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/tech4.PNG" alt="">
            <br>
            <li>Natural language understanding (NLU): This is the process in which chatbots convert text into structured data for machine understanding. In order to respond to customers, Bot message analysis must complete the following 3 steps: entities, context, and expectations (Snigdha, 2020).
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Entities: it is based on a specific request, keywords.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Context: it will rely on the flow of the conversation so that it can give a reasonable response without requiring the user to repeat their previous requests.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expectation: Bot will give the most appropriate response for the current situation which can fulfill the customer satisfaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Natural language processing (NLP): There are 5 steps to processing the natural language
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Tokenization: encodes the message into a language that the computer can understand.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Sentiment analysis: control emotions through customers' words to give positive feedback tailored to their feelings.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Normalization: Bot will check for errors in the text and filter out words that can change the meaning of the text.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Entity recognition: it filters out keywords/categories to constitute the content of the conversation so that it understands the content the user wants to convey.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Dependency Parsing: it uses the most common phrases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Chatbots are improving and smarter day by day, which is of great help to customer service because of their fast response. It provides a 24/7 service to save human resources. It is really convenient when customers do not need to wait when they want to talk to employees or management. Thanks to chatbots, the percentage of people who interact with the brand is much higher using traditional methods. When interacting with chatbots, customers will be more open, they do not feel appreciated even when asking silly questions. For instance, when we call customer service, we are usually more cautious while interacting, but as for chatbots, we know that it's not human so we don't have any sense of pressure. language and in terms of time when more than one question can be asked until it has been answered.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Chatbots are used a lot in my everyday life as a marketer. I use chatbots as a tool for customer service because of the benefits it provides. Currently, chatbots are also being applied to an English-teaching startup school that I am working for. The trainees were advised immediately to be instructed to schedule an appointment for an entrance examination. Chatbots help me a lot in being online and responding to customer messages, saving money for a startup.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>GPS in real time</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Global Position System (GPS) is currently the only system that allows you to accurately position your position whether you are moving or standing still, it can still locate your position regardless of the weather and at any given moment. To give customers suggestions, we need to know where their location is, thereby guiding them the way and location through their location signal. The GPS system has 3 segments:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 28 satellites located in different orbits, traveling at 7000 miles per hour and 11,000 nautical miles from Earth (Library of Congress, n.d).</li>
            <br>
            <li>There are a lot of receivers to transmit signals such as phones, cars, smartwatches, laptops, computers, aircraft, cameras, ...</li>
            <br>
            <li>To ensure the satellites work properly, the control segment consists of ground stations that are located around the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/tech5.PNG" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>We are determined based on how satellites work as stars in the sky we have known their location, the ground stations emit radio signals to detect your location through receivers. This system is capable of recording data. GPS was created to protect global security to guard border areas as well as track down bad guys who are trying to hide. At first, the military did not openly use GPS as widely as it is now because they fear that bad guys, those with a reactionary plot, will use it for bad purposes. Therefore, when GPS was announced for widespread use, some functions were restricted for global security purposes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>GPS is used every day when the GPS system tells us our location to share the best traffic route that takes us to where we need to go. GPS application is used a lot when we join traffic to know the routes, besides the technology motorcycle "grab", "uber", "goviet", "gojek", ... are applications that use GPS as a powerful tool to assist drivers on the right route, saving time and effort. Nowadays, parents are worried about losing their children so they have started buying watches with navigation devices so that they can easily follow their children.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks to GPS, I no longer have to worry when looking for new places in Ho Chi Minh. Besides, the GPS system is an indispensable part for me because I often use GPS to share my location with friends or relatives if I take a bus or taxi home late, avoid the bad case. happening. Thanks to the GPS system I feel a lot more secure when someone with me tracks the route until I get home. In some case, the location is not stable or it gives hints about inappropriate routes. However, in the near future, I believe this service will be much more improved.</p>
